This repository hosts my personal portfolio site, built with GitHub Pages. The portfolio showcases my key projects, skills, and experience as a recent Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University. It serves as a hub for my development work, featuring projects in full-stack development, game development, and hardware-software integration.
